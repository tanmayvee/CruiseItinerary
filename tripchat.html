                <p>2:30 - 3:00 PM: 10 Minutes Ride from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central</p>
                <p>Begin with a short, scenic ferry ride across Victoria Harbour on the iconic Star Ferry, offering</p>
                    beautiful views of the city skyline</p>
                <p>Fun Fact: Did you know the Star Ferry in Hong Kong has been around since 1888? That's over 130 years
                    of taking people across the harbor! Imagine how many pairs of shoes those ferries have carried and
                    probably a few grumpy passengers too! These little boats started out to help people get from one
                    side of the city to the other, but even today, they’re still the best way to enjoy Hong Kong’s
                    stunning skyline. So, while everyone else is stuck in traffic, you can sit back, relax, and take a
                    scenic boat ride like it’s still the 19th century – minus the horse-drawn carriages, of course!</p>
<!--here-->
                <li>★ The Peak Tram</li>
                <p>Next, take the Peak Tram – it’s a steep ride, but don’t worry, it won’t make your knees wobble!
                    You’ll zip up to Victoria Peak for panoramic views that’ll make you feel on top of the world
                    (literally)!</p>
                <p>Fun Fact: The Peak Tram is one of the steepest funicular railways in the world, climbing up to
                    Victoria Peak at an angle of 27 degrees! It’s been hauling passengers since 1888, just like the Star
                    Ferry. (Apparently, 1888 was a big year for Hong Kong transport!)</p>

                <li>★ Maxim's Palace</li>
                <p>Next stop: Maxim’s Palace for dim sum! It’s like a food parade – the carts roll by, and you just grab
                    whatever looks delicious. It’s the best kind of decision-making—no wrong answers, just tasty bites!
                </p>
                <p>Fun Fact: Maxim’s Palace is famous for its dim sum served from rolling carts. It’s not just
                    delicious—it's a Hong Kong tradition! Fun fact: Maxim's has been serving dim sum for over 50 years
                    and is one of the most famous dim sum spots in the city.</p>

                <li>★ HK Space Museum</li>
                <p>Next, head to the Hong Kong Space Museum! You’ll see huge models of planets, stars, and even a moon
                    rock. It’s like a little trip to space, without needing a spacesuit!</p>
                <p>Fun Fact: The Hong Kong Space Museum has a giant, 20-meter-wide planetarium dome—one of the biggest
                    in Asia! Fun fact: The museum’s exhibit about space travel includes a real moon rock brought back
                    from one of NASA’s Apollo missions.</p>
